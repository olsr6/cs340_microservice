# Instructions for how to Programmatically REQUEST AND RECIEVE Data from the Microservice
1. Add 'microservice.py' to your program's main directory.
2. Create a source path variable that stores the location of the file that you want to move.
3. Create a destination path variable that stores the location of where you want the file to move to.
4. Set up a Python subprocess call to run 'microservice.py', passing in the source path as the first argument and the destination path as the second argument, and store it into a variable you will remember.
5. Store the stdout from the subprocess call into a new variable
